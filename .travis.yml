language: python
python: 3.8
os: linux
dist: focal

branches:

    - /pyup\/.*/

install:
  # We need pip>=18.0 to handle the extra requirements below.
  - python -m pip install 'pip>=18.0'
  # When installing, include dependencies needed to run tests.
  - pip install .[test]

script:
  # Run test the suite of our package. (Here we use pytest, but of
  # course you might use any other way to run the tests.)
  - pytest tests/test_basic.py
  #
  # .. _run_pyi_tests:
  #
  # Run all discoverable PyInstaller tests which are in a package
  # starting with ``pyi_hooksample.``. The final period is
  # important -- this ensures we only get
